# The AI Founder's Go-to-Market Playbook

Welcome to the definitive go-to-market guide for AI founders. Traditional playbooks weren't built for the speed and nuance of AI. This framework is your strategic co-pilot, designed to help you navigate the 25 primary GTM channels.

> **A Note on Frameworks:** This playbook is heavily inspired by the Bullseye Framework from Gabriel Weinberg and Justin Mares' seminal book, *Traction*. While their framework is a timeless starting point for any startup, this guide adapts and extends it specifically for the unique challenges and opportunities of building in the fast-paced world of AI. We've updated the channels and added an AI-specific lens to the strategies.

**How to Use This Playbook:** As a founder, your resources are finite. This guide is structured to mirror your decision-making process.
1.  **Review the Table of Contents:** Get a high-level overview of the GTM categories and channels.
2.  **Jump to a Category:** Use the links to navigate to a relevant section.
3.  **Analyze Channels:** Within each category, review the individual channels. Use the filters (`Best For`, `Effort`, `Cost`) to prioritize what's relevant for you *right now*.
4.  **Get Inspired:** Look at the `Examples` and the **`How They Used It`** blurb to see who is winning with each channel.
